# AI Governance Portal - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The AI Governance Portal is a comprehensive platform for managing AI adoption, governance, and training within enterprise organizations. Built with modern cloud-native technologies, it provides real-time metrics, workflow orchestration, compliance tracking, and a centralized Knowledge Hub powered by Backstage and Langfuse integration.

## Technology Stack

### Core Platform
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime + Storage)
- **API Gateway**: Kong
- **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Next.js + Tremor (React)
- **Documentation**: MkDocs Material
- **Training Tracker**: Custom FastAPI service
- **Workflow Engine**: Temporal
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Knowledge Hub**: Backstage Developer Portal
- **LLM Observability**: Langfuse (External API)

### Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Tracing**: Jaeger + OpenTelemetry

## Data Architecture

### Core Data Models

1. **IMPACT Metrics**
   - Implementation (0-100%)
   - Momentum (0-100%)
   - Performance (0-100%)
   - Acceptance (0-100%)
   - Cost-Effective (0-100%)
   - Trust (0-100%)

2. **Squads**
   - Shadow → Federated → Autonomous progression
   - Product Owner & Risk Officer assignments
   - Adoption rate tracking
   - Maturity level (1-5)

3. **Training**
   - Tiered curriculum (Tier 1 + 4 specialized tracks)
   - Enrollment and progress tracking
   - Completion certificates
   - Learning paths

4. **Audit & Compliance**
   - Event logging with compliance flags
   - ISO 42001, CNBV, Banxico tracking
   - Resource access monitoring
   - Violation detection

### Database Schema

Key tables:
- `impact_metrics`: Time-series IMPACT data
- `adoption_metrics`: Provider-specific metrics
- `squads`: Team federation status
- `audit_events`: Compliance audit trail
- `training_enrollments`: Course progress
- `workflows`: Temporal workflow state
- `knowledge_base`: Vector embeddings for AI search

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Row-level security (RLS) on all tables
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management for service accounts

### Compliance
- ISO/IEC 42001, 23053, 23894, 27001
- CNBV and Banxico regulations
- GDPR data privacy
- Audit logging for all actions

### Network Security
- TLS encryption for all services
- API rate limiting via Kong
- CORS configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Configure environment variables
docker-compose up -d
```
